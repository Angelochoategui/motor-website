### Let’s start with the basics. Documentation.

#### Qlik Dev Site: https://qlik.dev/

The new Qlik Dev site is a developer portal and the best documentation resource for anyone seeking to become a Qlik Sense web developer. Its offerings are broken down into four categories: Basics, Tutorials, APIs, and Libraries & Tools.

Note that this documentation is focussed on the Qlik Sense SAAS editions. APIs may vary if you are using Qlik Sense Enterprise.

<b>Basics</b>

As a beginner, you can start by learning all the basics and ensure that your Qlik API journey starts on a solid foundation. The Basics section includes an introduction of the developer portal and the basics on how to build client extensions and web solutions using the platform, as well as embedding analytics in your external solutions.

You can get more information on concepts such as pagination, authentication and getting started with the Qlik Sense SAAS APIs, namely via REST, Command Line or JSON-RPC. Understanding the different ways you can communicate with the Qlik engine works and the various types of APIs offered are both equally important for your learning and growth as a web developer.

<b>Tutorials</b>

qlik.dev also offers a range of introductory tutorials to authenticate, automate, extend and integrate Qlik Sense. If building mashups is your thing, focus on the integration tutorials, which covers how to get started with basic web imtegrations. For example, ‘Build a simple web app’ offers an in-depth step-by-step procedure that you can follow and create a simple web app from scratch. Your app will integrate with your Qlik Sense SaaS tenant.

With the tutorial, you will learn how to use web integrations, executing REST calls, and set up web sockets towards the Qlik associative engine.

<b>APIs</b>
The APIs section looks into the REST API, JavaScript API, and JSON RPC API. Understanding how to use these APIs is crucial for you to level up your Qlik API skills. REST API documentation includes API keys for you to gain programmatic access to the Qlik platform, apps to interact with Qlik Sense, Extensions, Spaces, Reloads, Audits, Collections, CSP origins, and Items.
Libraries & Tools
In this section, you will get all the resources you need to learn how to use Qlik.cli, Enigma.JS, Enigma-GO, and Nebula.JS. Enigma JS is a great library to learn how to communicate with the Qlik Associative Engine in JavaScript environments. Visit the library & tools section to learn how to get started.
