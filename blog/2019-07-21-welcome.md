Welcome to Motor JS. The React Framework for Qlik Sense mashups.

We've built this library to provide an easy solution for building Qlik Sense Mashups in React. 
More than a series of components and charts, Motor JS is a complete framework for building mashups with ease.
<!--truncate-->

The library enables easy connection to a Qlik engine, a theming framework which propogates throughout your dashboard, 
interactive charts, components such as a Filter and Search and re-usable React hooks for the easy creation of data sets
off the engine. The library is built in React and supports Typescript out of the box.
