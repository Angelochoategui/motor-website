#### Context for accessing the Engine API

## Usage

You can access the Qlik engine in any component in your React component tree, see below for an example which returns the engine to the console.


```js

import React, { useContext } from 'react'
import { EngineContext } from '@motor-js/core'

const Example = () => {

  const { engine, engineError } = useContext(EngineContext)

  console.log(engine)
  
  return (
    <div>
    </div>
  )
}

export default Example

```
