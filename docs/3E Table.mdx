#### Table Component. Display data in a tabular format.

## Usage

We recommend you start by wrapping your React document with the Motor parent component.
This handles two things:

- Connection to the Qlik Engine (you can pass configuration or the engine object directly)
- Theming

The simpliest method to render a KPI is to add a Kpi element to the page and set the cols props.

```javascript

import { Table } from @motor-js/core
//...
<Tble cols={[ "=Sum([Sales Quantity])"]} />

```

This can get more complex by setting various other propertes with in the cols property which will allow for the naming of columns and the ability to sort the data.

A more advanced version demonstrating this is displayed below.
