Motor js also supports using the Capability APIs in your React mashups. These APIs will <b>only</b> be loaded
into your mashup if you use one of the components that are built with these APIs (these are clearly marked in the sidebar).

:::info
By loading the Capability APIs into your mashup, you are also loading CSS files from the Qlik server. 
Note that these may clash with your mashup CSS.

The Capability APIs are a collection of java script APIs that enable you easily embed Qlik objects into your web page and also probides various methods for interacting with the engine. See the Qlik [docs](https://qlik.dev/apis/javascript/capabilities) for more information.
