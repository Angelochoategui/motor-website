#### useSearch hook. A hook allowing the user to retrive data usinga QLik hypercube.

## Usage

Hooks are a new addition in React. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. To learn more abou hook in react please read : <a>https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html</a>

The motivation for introducing hooks in React are:

- It’s hard to reuse stateful logic between components
- Complex components become hard to understand
- Classes confuse both people and machines
- Complex components become hard to understand

To solve these problems, Hooks let you use more of React’s features without classes.

We have tried to expose hooks used in the libary so that you can create your own visualisations if you wish.

```javascript

import { useSearch } from @motor-js/core
//...

  const { searchResults, select } = useSearch({
    engine,
    searchValue,
    dimensions,
    qCount,
    qGroupItemCount,
  });

```

Once data has been retrived from the search hook it can then pass it on to an object to render its contents.

## Props

:::info
You do not need to set the Config prop if the component is a child of the Motor component
:::

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Prop</th>
    <th>Description</th>
    <th>Options / Example</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>engine</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      Configuration object to connect to the Qlik Engine, only set this if used
      outside of the Motor component.
    </td>
    <td>
      <code>object</code> <br />
      const &#123;(engine, engineError)&#125; = useEngine(config);
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>searchValue</code>
    </td>
    <td>Value to be search for.</td>
    <td>
      <code>string</code>
      <br />
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>dimensions</code>
    </td>
    <td>
      List of the search fields. If empty, the search is performed in all fields
      of the app.
    </td>
    <td>
      <code>array</code>
      <br />
      See sample syntax below
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>qCount</code>
    </td>
    <td>Number of search groups to return.</td>
    <td>
      <code>number</code>
      <br />
      See sample syntax below
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>
      <code>qGroupItemCount</code>
    </td>
    <td>Number of search groups to return.</td>
    <td>
      <code>number</code>
      <br />
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

## Sample Syntax

### useSearch configuration

```jsx {2,6-12}
import React from "react";
import { useEngine, useSearch } from "motor-ui";

function SearchObject({ engine }) {

   const { searchResults, select } = useSearch({
    engine,
    searchValue,
    dimensions,
    qCount,
    qGroupItemCount,
