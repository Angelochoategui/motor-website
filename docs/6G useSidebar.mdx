#### useModal hook. A hook allowing the user to retrive data usinga QLik hypercube.

## Usage

Hooks are a new addition in React. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. To learn more abou hook in react please read : <a>https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html</a>

The motivation for introdcuitng hooks in React are:

- It’s hard to reuse stateful logic between components
- Complex components become hard to understand
- Classes confuse both people and machines
- Complex components become hard to understand

To solve these problems, Hooks let you use more of React’s features without classes.

We have tried to expose hooks used in the libary so that you can create your own visualisations if you wish.

```javascript

import { useSidebar } from @motor-js/core
//...

const {isOpen, toggle} = useSidebar();

```

## Sample Syntax

### useModal configuration

```jsx {8,14-16}
import React from "react";
import { useSidebar, Sidebar } from "motor-ui";


function SideBarObject() {

 {
     const {isOpen, toggle} = useSidebar();
    return (
      <>
        <Motor
          config={config}>
          <div style={{overflow: 'hidden', height: '300px', width: '500px'}}>
          <Sidebar collapsable padding='100px 5px' isOpen={isOpen} backgroundColor='lightblue'>
            Sidebar Content
          </Sidebar>
          <Button onClick={toggle}>Toggle Sidebar</Button>
          </div>
        </Motor>
      </>
    )
  )
}
